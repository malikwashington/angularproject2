Angular Assignment: Data Table with Search and Pagination

Objective

Develop a single-page Angular application that reads data from a local JSON file and displays it in a sortable, searchable, and paginated table.

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate understanding of Angular fundamentals, data handling via services, template-driven UI rendering, and basic user interactions.

Functional Requirements

1. Data Source

Create a local JSON file in the project.
The JSON file should contain approximately 50 records.
Each record should include:
id
name
At least 2 additional meaningful fields (example: email, role, status, category, etc.).
2. Data Access

Create a service file to read and provide data from the JSON file.
The component should consume data only through the service (no direct JSON import in the component).
3. Landing Page Layout

The landing page should contain:
A carousel section at the top (static or dummy content is acceptable).
Below the carousel, a table that displays data from the JSON file.
 
4. Table Requirements

The table must:
Be created using Angular template syntax (not third-party table libraries).
Display data populated from the JSON file via the service.
Be sorted in ascending order based on a meaningful field (for example: name or id).
The table should clearly show column headers and rows.
5. Search Functionality

A search input box must be provided above the table.
Search behavior:
Search should start as soon as the user starts typing.
Results should dynamically update without page reload.
Search should filter table rows based on at least one field (example: name).
When searching:
Results must be shown only in the same table format.
Pagination should still apply to search results
6. Pagination

Add pagination controls at the bottom of the table.
Pagination rules:
Each page should display exactly 10 records.
Pagination must work for:
Full dataset
Filtered (search) results
Page navigation should update the table data accordingly.
